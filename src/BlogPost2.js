        <h4>Programming isn't Everything</h4>

        It's important to take time to do the little things in life. I had a busy weekend and although I tried to rest yesterday, I certainly didn't get enough. So instead of going hard at programming today. (I was going to focus on some basic JS to make sure I can speak about it as well as I can use it.) Instead, I've recognized that I need some rest.

      <p>
        So, I've spent the day:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Listening to a new book.</li>
          <li>Working on a crochet project. (While listening to the book.)</li>
          <li>Watching some mindless TV.</li>
          <li>Some very light cleaning.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Tonight, I plan on reading some fantasy while taking a bubble bath. The javascript and the algorithms will still be there tomorrow when I'm mentally and physically better prepared to work on them.</p>
